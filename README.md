# Hollowpoint

An unfinished experimental Dart backend for PureScript, initially undertaken in order to learn more about compilers and language ecosystems generally and PureScript's specifically.

Development by the original author of the backend ceased for the indefinite future as of approximately March 2020 (at PureScript 0.13.6) when the project was in a provisionally working but unfinished and untested state.
